    "*A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interfaces with end users, applications, and the database itself to gather and process data\n",
    "Relational databses is a common type of DBMS. They strcucture data into tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each table symbolizes an entity, where rows hold individual records and columns represent attributes. Data structuring is based on the interrelations among tables, utilizing keys (typically primary keys) to interlink records throughout the tables. This relatonal framwork facilitates efficient data access and supports the execution of complex queries using SQL.*"

An alternate approach could be letting students, faculty, administrators, etc. use shared Google Sheets to create, retrieve, update, and delete information. What are some problems with the shared spread sheet approach and what functions do DMBS implement to solve the problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Data Redundancy: Using Google sheet can lead to unnecessary duplication since the same data might be stored in multiple locations across various sheets. DBMSs apply normalization methods to reduce this data redundancy and guarantee more efficient data storage. 2. Scalability: As the scale of a university expands, so does the volume of data and the number of users, potentially quite significantly. DBMSs are engineered to be scalable, which allows educational institutions to manage growing datasets and increasing user activity without a drop in system performace. 3. Data Retrieval and Query Complexity. As the amount of data and its complexiy increase, sourcing and querying information in Google sheets can become laborious. DBMSs, however, provide SQL queries and indexing capabilities that enable the efficient extraction of particular data points, even from extensive datasets.*"
